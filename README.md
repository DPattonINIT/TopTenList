//Exercise: Top Ten Websites
//Description: We created a website of top ten motorcycles and cars. Each item is paired with review video, descritpion and photo. We also added website responsiveness for a tablet by changing the color of background and rearranging the layout of the content.
//Peer Review: really good design looks like an actual real website.
